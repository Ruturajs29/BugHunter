ID,Bug Line,Explanation
16,1,"Line 1: rdi.smartVec().vecEditMode(TA::VECD) uses TA::VECD but CONTEXT says it must be TA::VTT for runtime editing of vectors. Evidence: DOCS states ""When rdi.smartVec().label().copyLabel() is used and different vectors in the same label are to be edited, only the VTT mode can be used to edit vectors."" and CONTEXT mentions ""mode for editing vectors at runtime""."
32,"3,5","Line 3: rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func().burst(""MPBurst2"").burst() uses a duplicate .burst() call, which should likely be .execute() instead of the second .burst(), as indicated by the CONTEXT and DOCS that describe the usage of .burst() and .execute() in the func() class. Similarly, Line 5: rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func().burst(""MPBurst1"").burst() also uses a duplicate .burst() call, which should likely be .execute() instead of the second .burst(). Evidence: CONTEXT describes the usage of .func() with .burst() for dynamic mode, and DOCS provide examples where .burst() is followed by .execute() for execution."
25,5,"Line 5: RDI_END appears before RDI_BEGIN, but CONTEXT and STATIC hints indicate that RDI_END should be after RDI_BEGIN, indicating a wrong lifecycle order. Evidence: CONTEXT mentions the correct order of RDI_BEGIN and RDI_END, and STATIC hints explicitly state that ""RDI_END appears before RDI_BEGIN - wrong lifecycle order""."
10,"2,4","Line 2: rdi.pmux(4).module(""02"").readHumanSeniority().execute(); should be rdi.pmux(4).module(""02"").readHumidity().execute(). Evidence: CONTEXT mentions ""Reads the actual measured humidity of the selected PMUX card from the hardware"". Line 4: int hum = rdi.id(4).getHumanSeniority(""02""); should be int hum = rdi.id(4).getHumidity(""02"");. Evidence: CONTEXT mentions ""Reads the actual measured humidity of the selected PMUX card from the hardware"" and the function name getHumanSeniority does not match the context, it should be getHumidity."
26,"5,9","Line 5: .addWaveform(wav3, 2) should be .addWaveform(wav3). Evidence: CONTEXT states ""rdi.dc().addWaveform() Adds one or more waveforms in an execute() operation."" which implies that addWaveform() does not take a second argument. Line 9: .addWaveform(wav2, 3) should be .addWaveform(wav2). Evidence: Same as Line 5, CONTEXT states that addWaveform() does not take a second argument."
23,22,"Line 7: rdi.smartVec(""id"").burstUpload().begin(); should be rdi.smartVec(id1).burstUpload().begin();. Evidence: CONTEXT mentions that burstUpload will help to reduce the result uploading time and the results of multiple smartVec read commands, and CANDIDATE L5 suggests that the wrong smartVec id is used. Additionally, CONFIDENCE: high BUG_LINES: 9 EXPLANATION: Line 9: rdi.smartVec(id1) should be followed by .pin(""DATA2"").readBit(2, 2) as per the pattern of other smartVec calls, but the provided CANDIDATE L9 suggests a pin name mismatch for id2, not id1. However, the correct pin name for id1 is not provided in the given context. Also, CONFIDENCE: high BUG_LINES: 18 EXPLANATION: Line 18: rdi.smartVec(id3).pin(""DATA4"").readData(8, 8) should be rdi.smartVec(id3).pin(""DATA4"").readData(8, 12) as per the pattern of other smartVec calls, but the provided CANDIDATE L11 suggests a readData size mismatch for id3. And CONFIDENCE: high BUG_LINES: 22 EXPLANATION: Line 22: rdi.smartVec(id4).pin(""DATA4"").readData(8, 12) should be rdi.smartVec(id4).pin(""DATA2"").readData(8, 12) as per the pattern of other smartVec calls, but the provided CANDIDATE L13 suggests a pin name mismatch for id4. However, these last two are based on the assumption that the pattern of smartVec calls should be consistent, and the correct pin names and readData sizes for id3 and id4 are not provided in the given context. Therefore, the most confident bug is in Line 7."
4,3,"Line 3: iClamp(50 mA, -50 mA) uses the wrong argument order, it should be iClamp(-50 mA, 50 mA). Evidence: DOCS states ""Parameter Description: iClampLow, iClampHigh"" and STATIC hints also suggest the order is (low, high)."
31,"5,6","Line 5: vec_port1.push_forward(""label25"") should be vec_port1.push_back(""label25""). Evidence: The CONTEXT and DOCS do not mention a ""push_forward"" method for vectors, and the STATIC hint explicitly states that ""push_forward is not a standard vector method, should be push_back"". Similarly, Line 6: vec_port2.push_forward(""label31"") should be vec_port2.push_back(""label31""). Evidence: Same as Line 5."
17,8,"Line 8: rdi.id(""a"").getFFC() should be rdi.id(""a"").getFFV(). Evidence: The CONTEXT mentions getting the first fail vector, and the DOCS state that rdi.id().getFFV() is used to get the first fail vector, whereas getFFC is used to get the fail count."
27,"2,5","Line 2: rdi.dc().pin(""DPS_1,DPS_2"").imeasRange(100 uA) should be rdi.dc().pin(""DPS_1,DPS_2"").iMeasRange(100 uA). Evidence: DOCS ""rdi.dc().iMeasRange() Specifies a current measurement range."" and CONTEXT ""rdi.dc().iMeasRange()"". Line 5: rdi.dc(""im1"").pin(""DPS_0,DPS_1"").imeas().write() should be rdi.dc(""im1"").pin(""DPS_0,DPS_1"").iMeas().write(). Evidence: DOCS ""rdi.dc().iMeas() Creates a current measurement."" and STATIC hint ""Line 5: Possible typo - 'imeas' should be 'iMeas' (case-sensitive)""."
24,3,"Line 3: The pin name is ""D0"" but it should be ""DO"" to match the pin name used in the getVector method. Evidence: The CONTEXT mentions generating a new digital capture pattern with SmartRDI.Digital capture without hidden upload, and the CANDIDATES suggest that the pin name should be ""DO"" to match the getVector method. Additionally, the DOCS provide information on the rdi.digCap() function and its parameters, including the pin() function, which suggests that the pin name should match the one used in the getVector method."
14,3,"Line 3: rdi.dc(""a"").pin(""dig"").iForce(0).vMeas().execute(); - The pin name ""dig"" might not be the correct pin name for getting alarm DC results, it should be the pin name associated with the alarm ""a"". Evidence: CONTEXT mentions ""Getting alarm DC results on specific pins"" but does not explicitly state the correct pin name."
9,3,"Line 3: Duplicate .end() call is used, but CONTEXT and DOCS say it should be only one .end() call. Evidence: ""You can put your own rdi.wait() function before cogo().node().end(). If you use rdi.cogo().wait(double) in your code, SmartRDI can check whether this waiting time is long enough for the system-reserved waiting."" and STATIC hint ""Line 3: Duplicate .end() call detected"" indicate that the correct line should be: rdi.cogo().end();"
13,"3,4,5","Line 3: rdi.id(""cap"").getVesjkctor(); should be rdi.id(""cap"").getVector(). Evidence: The function name is misspelled, it should be getVector() as seen in the DOCS. Line 4: rdi.id(""idd"").getVslkhalue(); should be rdi.id(""idd"").getValue();. Evidence: The function name is misspelled, it should be getValue() as seen in the DOCS. Line 5: rdi.id(""dgr"").getWlkjnaveform(); should be rdi.id(""dgr"").getWaveform();. Evidence: The function name is misspelled, it should be getWaveform() as seen in the DOCS."
22,7,"Line 7: The function getTempThresh should be readTempThresh. Evidence: DOCS states ""Function readTempThresh() must be called upfront for the reading the programmed threshold from the hardware into the software cache."" and the correct line should be ""int tempTh = rdi.id(1).readTempThresh(""02"");"" as mentioned in CANDIDATES."
29,6,"Line 6: rdi.route().retrievePmuxPinStatus(""P0x08F1""); - The pin name ""P0x08F1"" does not match the previously set pin names ""P0x01F1"" and ""P0x07F1"". Evidence: CONTEXT mentions retrieving the status of a pmux switch, and the previously set pins are ""P0x01F1"" and ""P0x07F1"", but ""P0x08F1"" is not one of them. DOCS also state that the pin name should be defined in the routing setup file, but there is no indication that ""P0x08F1"" is a valid pin name in this context."
2,3,"Line 3: vForceRange(35 V) may exceed max allowed, should be vForceRange(30 V). Evidence: CONTEXT mentions the specification of AVI64 and CANDIDATES explicitly state that vForceRange(35 V) may exceed max allowed (30V for typical cards)."
20,5,"Line 5: samples(9216) exceeds max 8192 for burst site upload, should be samples(8192) or less. Evidence: DOCS states ""If it is set to true, the maximum sample number is 8192."" and CONTEXT mentions ""local control over the 'burst site upload' capacity for digital capture results"". Additionally, STATIC hint also mentions that ""samples(9216) exceeds max 8192 for burst site upload""."
11,"2,3","Line 2: iMeans should be iMeas. Evidence: DOCS state ""iMeas() Creates a current measurement."" and ""rdi.dc().iMeas()"". Line 3: vMeans should be vMeas. Evidence: DOCS state ""3.52. rdi.dc().vMeas()"" and ""vMeas vMeas()""."
3,"4,5","Line 4: The unit of the voltage should be in the format that the API supports, for example 31.0 instead of 31 V. Evidence: DOCS states ""11 vForcevForce((doubledouble dV dV););"" which implies that the voltage should be a double value without the unit. Line 5: The unit of the voltage should be in the format that the API supports, for example 13.5 instead of 13.5 V. Evidence: Same as above."
